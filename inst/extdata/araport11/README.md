# Araport11 blast results subset 

## `at_ATxGxx9xx.faa`

A subset of the proteins in the Araport11 annotation of *Arabidopsis thaliana*.

The models were filtered by matches of the pattern `AT.G..9` to TAIR IDs (This
represents 1/10 of the full dataset).

## `at_reverse_ATxGxx9xx.faa`

The same sequences as the above, but with their protein sequences reversed.
